# Library Management System ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Library Management System**, a command-line application built in Python using object-oriented programming. This system lets **admins** manage users & books, while **regular users** can search for, borrow, and return books. All data is persisted in text files, so your users, books, and borrow history stay intactâ€”even if you close and reopen the app!
